# Scerevisiae_RBP_motifs_in_Calbicans
Analysis of S. cerevisiae RBP motifs in CDS and UTRs of C.albicans genes

## src
### motif_counts
Contains R markdown (.Rmd) files implementing the motif counting and analysis. Also, the html files output by this analysis.
### motif_discovery
Contains R scripts for motif discovery plot in filamentous growth genes

## data
All genes in Candida albicans found by fungidb's "my strategies", then selected genomic sequences from 1000nt to 1nt upstream of ATG start codon, 1nt to 1000nt downstream of stop codon and all CDSs. Downloaded February 2021.
